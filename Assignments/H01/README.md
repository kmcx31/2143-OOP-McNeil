**Abstraction**
- The process of hiding all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.

**Attributes/Properties**
- *Attributes* - A specification that defines a property of an object, element or file.
- *Properties* - Special values that are included within a class/object, usually (depending on the language being used) set using get or set method calls.

**Class**
- An extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

**Class Variables**
- Any variable declared with the static modifier of which a single copy exists.

**Composition**
- A way to combine objects or data types into more complex ones.

**Encapsulation**
- The bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data.

**Friends**
- A function that is given the same access as methods to private and protected data.

**Inheritance**
- Allows a class to have the same behavior as another class and extend or tailor that behavior to provide special action for specific needs.

**Instance Variable**
- A variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance.

**Member Variable**
- A variable that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its methods.

**Method**
- Allows the object to perform an action, whether this action is to modify itself or to return a value.

**Multiple Inheritance**
- An object or class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent object or parent class. It is distinct from single inheritance, where an object or class may only inherit from one particular object or class.

**Object**
- Is an abstract data type created by a developer. It can include multiple properties and methods and may even contain other objects.

**Overloading**
- A set of processes in computer programming by which one special word or symbol may be given multiple meanings.

**Polymorphism**
- Refers to a set of processes in computer programming by which one special word or symbol may be given multiple meanings.

**Public/Private/Protected**
- *Public* - Any class can refer to the field or call the method.
- *Private* - Only the current class will have access to the field or method.
- *Protected* - Only the current class and subclasses (and sometimes also same-package classes) of this class will have access to the field or method.

**Virtual**
- Digitally replicated version of something real.
